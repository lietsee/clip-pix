This sound effect plays when ClipPix successfully saves an image from the clipboard.

### How to obtain the sound file:

2. Search for **"Confirmation Tone"** (duration: 0:01)
3. Download the MP3 file
4. Rename it to `save_success.mp3`
5. Place it in this directory (`assets/sounds/save_success.mp3`)

### Alternative sound effects:

You can use any short notification sound (0.2-1.0 seconds) in MP3 format. Good alternatives from Mixkit:
- "Correct Answer Tone"
- "Access Allowed Tone"
